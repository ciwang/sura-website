Delp transformed the field of biomechanics by creating highly accurate computer models of musculoskeletal structures and providing them to researchers worldwide using a software system (OpenSim) that he and his team developed. Delp invented fundamental technology for surgical navigation that is now in wide clinical use. Together with Mark Schnitzer and their students, Delp developed novel microendoscopes that allow realtime in vivo imaging of human muscle microstructure.

Cell shape plays a critical role in regulating many physiological functions, yet little is known about how the wide variety of cell shapes are determined and maintained. Inside the cell, many proteins organize and segregate, but how they detect and respond to the cellular morphology to end up at the right place at the right time is also largely mysterious. We utilize a combination of analytical, computational, and experimental approaches to probe physical mechanisms of shape-related self-organization in protein networks, membranes, and the cell wall. Current topics of interest are (i) cell-wall biosynthesis, (ii) the regulation and mechanics of cell division, (iii) membrane organization, and (iv) membrane-mediated protein interactions. Ultimately, the manipulation of cell shape may provide a direct tool for engineering complex cellular behaviors.","primary":"kchuang@stanford.edu","secondary":null,"website":"http:\/\/whatislife.stanford.edu\/LoCo.html","notes":null},{"name":"Lee Lab","pi":"Jin Hyung Lee","department":"Bioengineering, Neurology","goals":"The Lee Lab uses interdisciplinary approaches from biology and engineering to analyze, debug, and manipulate systems-level brain circuits.

The lesson that has been learned time and time again is that by measuring fundamental physical phenomena with increasing precision, one can make amazing discoveries and even sometimes stumble across new laws of nature. My research seeks to bring this tradition to biology. We have pursued two main avenues of technology development in order to improve biological measurement techniques. The first has been to develop the biological equivalent of the integrated circuit: microfluidic large scale integration (LSI). We routinely fabricate chips with thousands of micromechanical valves, each enabling exquisite control over its biological contents. These devices allow us to take advantage of the unusual physics of fluids in small volumes, which sometimes lend themselves to experiments which have no benchtop analogue. The second technology avenue we have pursued for precision measurement is the development and application of ultra high throughput DNA sequencing technology. My work in single molecule biophysics led to the first demonstration of single molecule sequencing, and my research in this field has led me to become deeply involved in human genetics, immunology, and the development of new clinical diagnostics.","primary":"quake@stanford.edu","secondary":"jchinen@stanford.edu","website":"http:\/\/thebigone.stanford.edu\/","notes":null},{"name":"Riedel-Kruse Lab","pi":"Ingmar Reidel-Kruse","department":"Bioengineering, Biophysics","goals":"The Riedel-Kruse lab combines basic research and engineering approaches by working on (1) biophysics of development and (2) biotic games.\n\n(1) We investigate how genetic networks orchestrate the dynamics and mechanics of developing embryos with a focus on oscillatory processes and molecular forces, with the long-term motivation to advance our understanding on human disease and tissue engineering.\n\n(2) Biotic games require biological process to run and could have a similar impact on society as conventional video games based on electronics; and we design and engineer biotic games specifically targeted at educational challenges and to support biomedical research.\n\nWe use theoretical \/ computational as well as experimental approaches based on molecular, cellular, developmental biology; zebrafish; imaging; physics; informatics \/ computer sciences; micro-fluidics; and engineering.","primary":"ingmar@stanford.edu","secondary":"ereiland@stanford.edu","website":"http:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/group\/riedel-kruse\/","notes":null},{"name":"Scott Lab","pi":"Matthew Scott","department":"Bioengineering, Developmental Biology","goals":"Matthew Scott is investigating how embryonic and later development is governed by proteins that control gene activity and signaling processes.
