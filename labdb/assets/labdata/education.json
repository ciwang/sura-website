As they participate in the PSC, teachers think deeply about both mathematics content and instruction, and they explore their instructional practices with their colleagues through the use of video and other classroom artifacts. One iteration of the PSC consists of three interconnected professional development workshops, all organized around a rich mathematical task. During Workshop 1, teachers collaboratively solve the mathematical task and develop plans for teaching it to their own students. Shortly after the workshop, the teachers implement the problem with their own students and their lessons are videotaped. In Workshop 2 teachers explore the role they played in implementing the problem. In Workshop 3 teachers critically examine students\u2019 mathematical reasoning.\nThe Problem-Solving Cycle model provides a structure for mathematics teachers to work together and share a common mathematical and pedagogical experience. Our previous research suggests that it is a promising model for enhancing teachers\u2019 knowledge and supporting changes in classroom practice.\nIn our current project, initiated in Fall 2007, we are working with a group of middle school mathematics teachers in a large urban district to foster their leadership capacity, and specifically to prepare them to facilitate the Problem-Solving Cycle. We will provide 2\u00bd years of preparation and support for teachers who have been designated as \u201cmathematics instructional leaders.\u201d These instructional leaders will in turn implement the PSC with the mathematics teachers in their schools. We will document the range and quality of the instructional leaders\u2019 implementation of the PSC. We will also analyze the impact of the professional development process on the mathematical knowledge and classroom teaching of the instructional leaders and the mathematics teachers with whom they work. In addition, we will analyze the impact on their students\u2019 mathematics achievement. By the conclusion of the project, we anticipate that the participating schools will have the infastructure and capacity to carry out the PSC indefinitely, using their own resources. In addition, the project will produce a highly refined set of PSC facilitation materials\u2014with a strong emphasis on supporting a linguistically and culturally diverse student population\u2014that can be widely disseminated.","Primary Contact":"hildab@stanford.edu","Secondary Contact":null,"Website":"https:\/\/ed.stanford.edu\/faculty\/hildab"},{"Lab\/Group Name":"Brazer Group","PI":"David Brazer","Department":"Graduate School of Education","Research Goals":"My research interests generally focus on the challenges of school and district leadership, exploring how those challenges are met in practice.

Laberee","Department":"Graduate School of Education","Research Goals":"I am currently working on a book about the historically evolved nature of American higher education (preliminary title: The Improbable Rise of American Higher Ed (and How It Works by Doing Everything Wrong).  American higher education is an anomaly.  In the second half of the 20th century it surged past its European forebears to become the dominant system in the world \u2013 with more money, influence, Nobel prizes, and drawing power than any of the systems that served as its models.  By all rights, this never should have happened.  Its origins were remarkably humble, arising from a loose assortment of parochial 19th century liberal arts colleges, which emerged in the pursuit of sectarian expansion and civic boosterism more than scholarly distinction.  It was not even a system in the usual sense of the word, since it emerged with no plan, no planner, no prospects, and no reliable source of support.  Yet these weaknesses of the American system in the 19th century turned out to be strengths in the 20th.  From the difficult circumstances of trying to survive in an environment with a weak state, a divided church, and intense competition with peer institutions, American colleges developed into a system of higher education that was lean, adaptable, consumer-sensitive, self-supporting, and radically decentralized.  This put the system in a strong position to expand and prosper when, before the turn of the century, it finally got what it was most grievously lacking:  academic credibility (which came when it adopted elements of the German research university) and large student enrollments (which came when middle class families started to see social advantage in sending their children to college).   \n\nThis system is extraordinarily complex, bringing together contradictory educational goals, a broad array political constituencies, diverse sources of funds, and multiple forms of authority into a single institutional arena characterized by creative tension and local autonomy. One tension is between the influence of the market and the influence of the state. Another arises from the conflict among three social-political visions of higher education \u2013 as undergraduate college (populist), graduate school (elite), and land grant college (practical). A third arises from the way the system combines three alternative modes of authority \u2013 traditional, rational, and charismatic. In combination, these elements promote organizational complexity, radical stratification, broad political and financial support, partial autonomy, and adaptive entrepreneurial behavior.","Primary Contact":"dlabaree@stanford.edu","Secondary Contact":null,"Website":"https:\/\/ed.stanford.edu\/faculty\/dlabaree"},{"Lab\/Group Name":"LaFromboise Group","PI":"Teresa LaFromboise","Department":"Graduate School of Education","Research Goals":"Bicultural competence and resilience in ethnic minority adolescent development.
