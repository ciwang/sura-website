The dissertation version of this manuscript won the Harvard Department of Government\u2019s Toppan Prize for best dissertation in political science and the American Political Science Association's William Anderson Award for the best dissertation in the general field of federalism or intergovernmental relations, state and local politics. Clayton's other research projects encompass public policy, causal inference, political geography, and American political development.","Availability":null,"Primary Contact":"Clayton Nall (nall@stanford.edu)","Website":"http:\/\/www.nallresearch.com"},{"Lab\/Group":"Ober Group","PI":"Josiah Ober","Departments":"Political Science, Classics, Philosophy","Research Interests":"Ancient Greek Thought, Classics, Democracy, Philosophy, Political Theory\n","Biography and Research Goals":"Josiah Ober, the Constantine Mitsotakis Chair in the School of Humanities and Sciences, specializes in the areas of ancient and modern political theory and historical institutionalism.
