Four interconnected themes are being pursued.\n\nFirst, we are broadly interested in electrostatics in proteins and how electrostatics affect function. Our current work uses vibrational probes whose sensitivity to electric fields can be calibrated by Stark spectroscopy. Probes are introduced on inhibitors, by modification of amino acids and by incorporation of unnatural amino acids, and these are used to map electric fields for comparison with simulations and as probes of the role of protein electrostatics in enzymatic catalysis.\n\nSecond, we use supported lipid bilayers as mimics for cell surfaces and as tools in biotechnology. A broad vision is to engineer interfaces between hard surfaces and soft materials, ultimately leading to sophisticated biocompatible interfaces that can be used to control, interrogate or organize complex living systems. Recent work addresses the formation of domains and protein associations with these domains, interactions of DNA, proteins and cells with supported bilayers, and the mechanism of vesicle fusion. This work has motivated the development of advanced optical microscopy methods for probing the interface between membranes on solid supports and cell membranes. A novel type of imaging mass spectrometry is being applied to characterize the lateral organization and composition of bilayers and associated membranes with 50 nm resolution.\n\nThird, we have a long-standing interest in the mechanism of light-driven, long-distance electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centers, one of the fastest known reactions. This is being studied by femtosecond fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, site-specific mutagenesis and vibrational Stark spectroscopy.\n\nFourth, related methods are also being used to probe excited state dynamics, solvation, and electronic structure in variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP), widely used in cell biology. Recent work focuses on discoveries of photo-association and -dissociation of split GFPs that can be used to modulate complex functions using light, novel GFPs with alternative folds, and the mechanism(s) of ground and excited state proton transfer.\n","Primary Contact":"Steven Boxer (sboxer@stanford.edu)","Secondary Contact":"Debra Frank, Administrative Assistant (dfrank@stanford.edu)","Website":"http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/group\/boxer\/res_overview.html"},{"Lab\/Group Name":"Burns Lab","PI":"Noah Burns","Department":"Organic","Research Goals":"Research in our group explores the boundaries of modern organic synthesis in order to enable the more rapid creation of molecular complexity in a predictable and controllable fashion.

In addressing these we will exploit the unique ability of chemical synthesis to provide the practitioner with any conceivable alteration or derivative. We are also involved in the development of asymmetric methodologies based on new catalyst and reagent platforms.

The oligophenylenevinylene bridge of these molecules promotes rapid tunneling over remarkably long distances compared with other unsaturated and saturated bridges we have studied. For instance, starting in the activated complex, the tunneling rate between a gold electrode and an appended ferrocene through 3.5nm of an oligophenylenevinylene (OPV) bridge is 8 x 109 s-1 whereas the tunneling rate through an alkane bridge of the same length is expected to be slower than 1s-1.\n\nTo date our electron-tunneling studies have largely focused on what we casually denote as a \"one-electrode\" measurement with the molecular bridge connecting one electrode to a redox species which acts as a molecular capacitor to an ionically conducting solution.

Our early efforts have concentrated on the invention of new atom and group transfer-type reaction processes. The application of such methods to problems in natural product synthesis and chemical biology offers unique challenges in reaction design, and serves as the underlying motivation for our research. As one of our overarching goals, we wish to devise molecular systems for selective C-H amination and hydroxylation that integrate concepts in catalysis with those in molecular recognition. Such ideas are inspired by Nature and the metalloenzymes that perform hydrocarbon oxidation reactions with exquisite fidelity. A general interest in problems in molecular recognition and molecular design has stimulated our more recent work towards understanding the structure and physiology of ion channels. Altogether, projects in the group are intended to afford students expertise in synthetic chemistry while exposing them to problems in chemical kinetics and catalysis, physical organic and coordination chemistry, and structure design. Currently, we have four principal areas of concentration that include:  1. The elucidation of new reaction processes for carbon-heteroatom (C-N and C-O) bond formation through selective, metal-catalyzed C-H and s-bond functionalization.  2. Mechanistic analysis of Rh-promoted C-H amination; coordination chemistry and catalyst design.  3. Multi-step, asymmetric syntheses of complex, heterocyclic amine-derived natural products which include the manzacidins, tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin, aconitine, welwitindolinone, and agelastatin.  4. The development of guanidine toxin mimetics that function as tools for mapping the tertiary structure of the ion permeation pathway in voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ ion channel proteins.\n\nREACTION DEVELOPMENT. We have delineated new strategies for the selective conversion of saturated C-H bonds to carbinolamine stereocenters. This methodology has general utility in synthesis and makes available large numbers of amine derivatives from inexpensive and easily prepared starting materials. Prior to our investigations, it was not possible to consider C-H bond amination in the retrosynthetic planning of a target molecule. We have shown, however, that such a reaction can indeed be accomplished with the aid of a dinuclear Rh catalyst and a commodity oxidant, using both simple and structurally diverse substrates. Currently, we seek to identify other catalyst structures that operate with efficiencies comparable to those of the Rh systems. Our ability to alter the ligand framework of the catalyst complex will enable us to influence chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivities in the C-H bond amination event. Efforts in catalyst design are tied strongly to mechanistic studies that have attempted to identify key reactive intermediates on the pathway to C-H bond amination.\n\nTARGET-DIRECTED SYNTHESIS AND MOLECULAR DESIGN. The development of novel synthetic strategies to complex target molecules such as tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin, aconitine, and the manzacidins serves to underscore the value of our reaction methods for simplifying problems in chemical synthesis. We have successfully completed the preparation of both tetrodotoxin and manzacidins A and C. The availability of these compounds through de novo synthesis affords us unique opportunities to craft structurally analogous molecular probes for exploring the structure and function of their respective protein targets. Current efforts are also aimed at the preparation of saxitoxin and aconitine, both of which are known to act on voltage-gated Na+ ion channels.\n\nIn combination with our progress towards a saxitoxin synthesis, we are preparing structural mimics of this target that maintain many of the key architectural elements thought to be essential for its bioactivity. The proposed compounds have been conceived through the aid of computer modeling, from which it has been possible to assess both molecular conformation and electrostatic surface potentials. Saxitoxin is known to block ion channel conductance by occluding the mouth of the channel pore. Analogs of this natural product can be used in combination with protein mutagenesis experiments to map the tertiary structure of the saxitoxin binding site. Through these studies, we hope to gain an understanding of the protein recognition features that impart selectivity for Na+ ions. Moreover, the availability of small molecules that disrupt the normal functioning of ion channels can be employed to study the mechanism by which ion flux across a membrane is coupled to downstream cellular signaling events. In all, our research program, which has at its core complex molecular synthesis and reaction development, positions us uniquely to address questions that are of relevance to understanding the neurophysiology of voltage-gated channel proteins.\n\n\n\n\n","Primary Contact":"Justin Du Bois (jdubois@stanford.edu)","Secondary Contact":null,"Website":"http:\/\/duboislab.stanford.edu\/welcome"},{"Lab\/Group Name":"Fayer Lab","PI":"Michael Fayer","Department":"Biophysical","Research Goals":"My research group studies complex molecular systems by using ultrafast multi-dimensional infrared and non-linear UV\/Vis methods.

Our ultrafast measurements provide direct observables for understanding the relationships among dynamics, structure, and intermolecular interactions.\n\nBulk properties are frequently a very poor guide to understanding the molecular level details that determine the nature of a chemical process and its dynamics.  Because molecules are small, molecular motions are inherently very fast. Recent advances in methodology developed in our labs make it possible for us to observe important processes as they occur. These measurements act like stop-action photography. To focus on a particular aspect of a time evolving system, we employ sequences of ultrashort pulses of light as the basis for non-linear methods such as ultrafast infrared two dimensional vibrational echoes, optical Kerr effect methods, and ultrafast IR transient absorption experiments.\n\nWe are using ultrafast 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy and other multi-dimensional IR methods, which we have pioneered, to study dynamics of molecular complexes, water confined on nm lengths scales with a variety of topologies, heterogeneous catalysts bound to surfaces, organic ionic liquids, and membranes. We can probe the structural transformations of these systems. The methods are somewhat akin to multidimensional NMR, but they probe molecular structural evolution in real time on the relevant fast time scales. We are obtaining direct information on how nanoscopic confinement of water changes its properties, a topic of great importance in chemistry, biology, geology, and materials. For the first time, we are observing the motions of molecular heterogeneous catalysts bound to surfaces.

Using ultrafast optical heterodyne detected optical Kerr effect methods, we can follow processes from tens of femtoseconds to ten microseconds. Our ability to look over such a wide range of time scales is unprecedented. The change in molecular dynamics when a system undergoes a phase change is of fundamental and practical importance.

As an alternative strategy, we are developing catalysts and catalyst\u2013surface interfaces that exploit non-bonding electrostatic interactions to control selectivity.

Toward this goal, we have been pursuing the discovery of new chemical reactions that generate a fluorescence signal; we then modify DNAs to perform these reactions in a cell upon finding a specific RNA. Such molecules can detect a single base alteration in a DNA or RNA target; such mutations are causative in many diseases. We are developing these probe chemistries for use in identifying pathogenic bacteria and cancer-related sequences in human cells.\n\nA second project involves the development of new fluorescent molecular assemblies built on a DNA scaffold.

We take a different approach-extending quantum chemistry into the time domain, bridging the gap between traditional molecular dynamics (what are the atoms doing?) and quantum chemistry (what are the electrons doing?). We include quantum mechanical effects on the behavior of the electrons and the atoms by simultaneously solving the electronic and nuclear Schr\u00f6dinger equations. This \"ab initio multiple spawning\" (AIMS) method opens exciting possibilities in modeling chemistry. Rearrangement of chemical bonds, tunneling, and dynamics on multiple electronic states are all treated correctly without ad hoc assumptions.\n\nWe are especially interested in electronic excited states, where the assumption of electron-nuclear separability breaks down. Using AIMS, we investigated fundamental photochemical reactions-quenching of excited metal atoms, cis-trans isomerization in ethylene and butadiene, and ring-opening of cyclobutene. In each case we found that conventional explanations required modification. This research furthers the understanding of complex molecular dynamics on multiple electronic states during photochemical reactions. Our goal is AIMS for reactions in complex environments, whether they be normal solvents (e.g., water), solid cages (e.g.,zeolites), or portions of a protein. We are developing methods to address solvent effects on photochemistry and spectroscopy, with ultimate application to biologically relevant molecules such as visual pigments.\n\nBecause of tunneling effects, proton transfer reactions require quantum treatment of the nuclei. We recently performed the first ab initio molecular dynamics simulation of real-time tunneling dynamics, simulating intramolecular proton transfer in malonaldehyde. Future directions include AIMS studies of coupled electron and proton transfer reactions, which are important in biological systems and possibly for designing molecular electronic devices.\n\nFinally, we use novel quantum chemistry methods to elucidate the function of biologically relevant metallo-proteins-currently, the reaction mechanism of cytochrome c oxidase.

The metalloenzyme structures and electronic spectroscopy provide critical insights into the intimate metal ligation that might be necessary to construct small functional synthetic metal complexes. Extending the chemistry beyond the constraints of a protein matrix is our ultimate goal.\n\nFor these redox active metal sites, the ligation environment is coupled tightly to the functional chemistry. Yet, focusing solely on the intimate metal ligation is not generally sufficient to create an efficient catalyst. Site-isolation of the active oxidant may also be necessary.
